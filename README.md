This mod provides customization options for users to modify the prompts, and it supports any large language model in the **GGUF** format.

## Features

- **LLM Integration**: Replaces the default love potion prompts with responses generated by an embedded LLM.
- **Customizable Prompts**: Configure the behavior of the LLM using a text file that defines the prompt.
- **Supports GGUF Models**: The mod supports any large language model in the **GGUF** format, allowing for easy integration of different models.
- **Configurable**: The model and prompt settings can be customized to suit your playstyle or requirements.

   - Download the LoveLLM mod from the official mod repository or the source you got it from.
   
2. **Install the mod**:
   - Place the mod files into the `Plugins` folder of your BepInEx installation directory.

3. **Configure the Model**:

   - See https://blog.steelph0enix.dev/posts/llama-cpp-guide/#building-the-llama for instructions on how to convert to gguf.

## Configuration

- **prompt.txt**:
   The prompt file is where you define the prompts. Modify this text file to adjust the promots. The value after the semicolon is used to control what type of chat possess message will get generated
   (Love potion = make your eyes pink.)
   
    1 = LovePotion,
    2 = Ouch,
    3 = SelfDestruct,
    4 = Betrayal,
    5 = SelfDestructCancel

   Example:

   You think the person {playerName} is sexy. Tell {playerName} that you just cannot stop thinking about them. Be creative but keep it short, one sentence. Use slang;1

- In this example, the prompt text is on the left hand side of the semi-colon, and on the right hand side is the chat effect id.

## Example Prompt File

```
The person {playerName} broke your heart. Generate some profanity about {playerName} use internet short hand. Keep it short, two sentences. Don't censor;4
